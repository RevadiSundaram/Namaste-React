# What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?
- Use named export when you want to export multiple variables or functions from a file.
- Use default export when you want to export only one variable or function from a file.
- Use named export when you want to keep the same name for your variables or functions across different files.
- Alternatively, we can use the * symbol to import all the named exports from a file as an object, which is very similar to other languages like python and java

- The useState() hook can conveniently hold strings, arrays, numbers, objects and much more.
